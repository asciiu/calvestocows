(burns 400 calories during a 20 minute session!..that\'s 20 calories/minute) Let\'s take a look at some different exercise variations and see why the kettlebell should be praised!\n\n<a href=\"http://www.couchdivorce.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/kettle-praise.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2905\" src=\"http://www.couchdivorce.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/kettle-praise-350x185.jpg\" alt=\"kettle praise\" width=\"350\" height=\"185\" /></a>\n\nIt\'s a belly blaster. Kettlebell swings are the perfect workout addition to either get your body warmed up for the workout, or as a workout finisher that will leave you crawling out of the gym. The greatest proponent of the kettlebell is it\'s versatility. When comparing these to olympic lifts for example, the incidence for injury and improper form is much more prolific with olympic lifts due to the complexity of the movements. So what are some efficient ways to use kettlebells to give you that carved core you\'ve been working towards?\n\n1) Kettlebell Swings\n\n<a href=\"http://www.couchdivorce.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/kettlebell.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2983\" src=\"http://www.couchdivorce.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/kettlebell-350x185.jpg\" alt=\"kettlebell\" width=\"350\" height=\"185\" /></a>\n\nIt\'s a relatively simple movement, and is ironically one of the harder movement to master (behind the deadlift).The answer is hidden in the classic film Happy Gilmore. It\'s all in the hips! I see too many newb\'s in the gym trying to squat their way through the swing as they violently flail their limbs like an ameba. Don\'t do this. You will probably throw your back out and pinch a nerve in your neck which will leave you looking like Sloth, from The Goonies for a few days.\n\n2) Turkish Get-ups\n\n[embed]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdAXt7YyGe0[/embed]\n\nThese one\'s are a little bit more advanced. Take a look at this video to understand the correct form for this belly flattening move. Remember to engage your core throughout the entire movement to avoid any back injuries.\n\n3)  Kettlebell Deadlifts\n\n<a href=\"http://www.couchdivorce.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/kettlebell-deadlift.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2984\" src=\"http://www.couchdivorce.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/kettlebell-deadlift-350x185.jpg\" alt=\"kettlebell deadlift\" width=\"350\" height=\"185\" /></a>\n\nThis one can be completed as a single leg deadlift (more advanced) or as a standard deadlift with both feet on the ground as your bend over and use both hands to lower the kettlebell much like you would with using a barbell. Again remember to engage your core and keep your back and neck aligned as your lower your body.\n\n4) Kettlebell Squat (Goblet Squat)\n\n<a href=\"http://www.couchdivorce.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/kettlebellsquat.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2985\" src=\"http://www.couchdivorce.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/kettlebellsquat-350x185.jpg\" alt=\"kettlebellsquat\" width=\"350\" height=\"185\" /></a>\n\nKeeping your back straight, lower your body down to the squat position. I like to pick a spot on the wall in front of me or on the ceiling and hold my stare on that position during the entire movement. This will keep you from dropping your head and neck while you\'re going into the squat position (which can put a lot of stress on your neck and back). Add these to your repertoire and watch those quads and abs start to pop!\n\n5) Kettlebell Clean-and-Press\n\n<a href=\"http://www.couchdivorce.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/kettlebell-clean-and-press.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2995\" src=\"http://www.couchdivorce.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/kettlebell-clean-and-press-350x185.jpg\" alt=\"kettlebell-clean-and-press\" width=\"350\" height=\"185\" /></a>\n\nThis one will make you hurt in muscles you didn\'t even know you had. The key here is alignment. You should imagine that the kettlebell is following a straight path up your body throughout the entire movement. This will keep you from raising the weight away from your body which can strain your neck, back or shoulders and can cause serious injury. Imagine you\'re doing a deadlift. If done properly you should be almost scrapping your shins with the barbell. The same concept applies here. Keep the weight closest to your body and use your hips and abs to generate power and watch the weight nearly take off out of your hand!\n\nGive these workouts a try and remember form is much more important than picking up the heaviest kettlebell you can find. Neck and back injuries are too easy to do so remember to keep your core tight and your back straight! Have fun with these and let me know what you think!\n\n-Max','','The Kettle King ','','publish','post','open','open','','the-kettle-king','','','2014-09-15 02:00:03','2014-09-15 02:00:03',0,0,'','http://www.couchdivorce.com/?p=2888',2888) made by call_user_func, WP_Import->dispatch, WP_Import->import, WP_Import->process_posts, wp_insert_post

Apparently, they got one of their sexy lady friends to take a naked selfie without showing her face. They took this picture and put it on on a craigslist personals post in the casual encounters section (where the rejects of Tinder go to get laid). On the post, they wrote that she is a nymphomaniac who loves big dicks and that they should text her their penis pics to her. Of course, the number on there was Adam\'s and he got over a thousand text messages that day and got to meet a lot of penises before he figured out how to stop it.\n\nNow, even if your sexual preferences involves a nice dicksickle, this response that Adam claimed to receive seemed rather overwhelming to say the least. To be honest, I thought that Adam may have exaggerated it a little bit so I decided to put it to the test. I made up an OkCupid (another Tinder reject site) profile and found a selfie of a very beautiful girl. I then proceeded to make up some information strictly based off of a friend\'s Pinterest page to bring together a fictitious background to make this girl seem real.\n\nI left this profile alone for 24 hours and returned to over a thousand messages and matches. It was insane. The content of the messages ranged from extreme sexual harassment to the dorky nice guy, but mostly guys trying to convince me how they would ravage my fake female body. I was shocked! The amount of attention was overwhelming and really creepy.\n\nNow, maybe this was just this specific website. I considered making a fake Tinder, but then I realized I would also need to make a fake Facebook profile, and decided it\'s much easier to ask one of my gorgeous lady friends about it. I asked this person what her Tinder experience was like. She responded that the Tinder culture is often about saying the raunchiest pickup lines right off the bat. Luckily, guys cannot message her without her also liking their Tinder page which reduces the random harassment.\n\nAfter this enlightenment, I decided to simply think about this world we live in. I knew women, especially women who are considered attractive, are constantly objectified and harassed, but I had no idea that it was on this level. In fact, I have heard female complaints about the crude mannerisms of us males, but I did not know how common this was. However, something hit me and I still do not know the answer. Why the hell are women putting their faces and profiles on these sites?! Is it because they are hoping to find the right guy? Or maybe this is actually what they are seeking? Maybe instead of the creepy stares, it is better to get a more direct creepy message? Why put up with this male gorilla level of matchmaking? Ultimately, I do not know and I\'m sure the answers vary from each individual.\n\nThere really isn\'t a point to this article other than a portrayal of how bored I get sometimes. However, I still am really curious about why people use these sites, specifically women, when I have heard some complaints about the people that they get to interact with on these platforms. One of my guesses is that many of these women just want to bang, but they wish they could only get dick pics from the ones they like. I mean, that\'s why they have categories on porn sites, according to Max (the roommate). But really, I am curious so if you have your own reasons feel free to email me at couchdivorcedarby@gmail.com and maybe I\'ll do a follow up.\n\nHere\'s Max\'s email so you can send him dick pics: couchdivorce@gmail.com.\n\n-Darby\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;','','Men Are Animals','','publish','post','open','open','','men-are-animals','','','2014-09-20 17:15:07','2014-09-20 17:15:07',0,0,'','http://www.couchdivorce.com/?p=3026',3026) made by call_user_func, WP_Import->dispatch, WP_Import->import, WP_Import->process_posts, wp_insert_post

I really mean this. As obvious as this sounds, I am amazed at how often people treat others with disrespect.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nMy friends and I will be nice to people because they are people. You are allowed to find others annoying and stupid. In fact, there is no way around this. However, even if that is the case, it is simple to nicely end a conversation with someone and never speak with him or her again or have a constructive conversation where both parties agree to disagree.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nNow, in the cases where you clearly try to be respectful, and attempt to walk away, but continue to be pestered, is when you can be firm in telling the person that you are not interested in continued interaction. If that person continues, then feel free to unleash your inner asshole and shit on them.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFurther, if someone is disrespectful to you for no justifiable reason, then you have every right to either try to walk away or, again, shit on them. I hate it when people are so entitled to treating others like shit for no reason. These same people are often surprised and offended when you decide to reflect their disrespect back at them.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWalking away is always the noble thing, but sometimes there is a time and place to take a stand and let them understand that their attitudes are not appreciated and let them feel the other end of the stick.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nRecently, I was at a party and I decided to speak to this guy sitting on the couch observing the drunkenness that surrounded him. I remember I used to do this at parties a while back because I went through a phase of existentialist hipster bullshit. Curious if he was in the same mindset I started to speak to him. I own a small tech firm and we have some openings for marketing positions, so I thought maybe if he was the right fit based on our conversation, I would ask him to come in for a interview. It began with small talk, and he responded with some answers. This guy was about 6 foot 4 inches tall, extremely fit, and black. Now, there is a reason I mention his skin color.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWe were at a college party, and he had on a university t-shirt. Again, this guy looked jacked. Well, maybe I shouldn’t have, but I tried being politically correct. I have a close friend who is black, on a full academic scholarship, about to graduate with honors, goes to a mostly white school, terrible at sports, and he gets asked constantly if he is a college athlete. He is extremely skinny, and nothing about him even hints at athletic ability. People ask him if he is an athlete because he is a black college student. He hates it.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThis guy at the party was built like a machine, and he wasn’t drinking alcohol, which made me wonder if he was an athlete. If he was an athlete then I would have been truly impressed at his self-control. Trying to be respectful, I explained to him, “Hey man, you look really fit and I was wonderi-“. He interrupted before I could finish and say, “wondering if you are an athlete”, he responded, “Man, are you fucking gay?”\n\n&nbsp;\n\nMaybe he just wanted to be left alone, and if that was the case, he could have simply said so, and I would have walked away. However, he didn’t and instead interrupted me with a personal question in a rude manner. I responded:\n\n&nbsp;\n\n“Look man, I am talking to you because you were doing something different from the rest of the people at the party. I own a company and we have four opening open for a marketing position. Our business is expanding and we are starting two new firms in the near future. However, you decided to ask an extremely personal question with malice for no reason that I can really see. Even if I was hitting on you, there is a better way to ask and say no. Further, what if I really was gay and you offended me through your implied homophobia and unnecessary aggression? Our firm does not want people like you who lack subtlety, sophistication, social awareness, etiquette, and clearly education. Marketing involves understanding people and working with them. Anyways, thank you for quickly showing me that you won’t be a good fit and don’t deserve my time. I hope your future is as nice as you are. Have a nice day.”\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI know I didn’t respond with a more aggressive and vulgar approach but this was because I was representing my firm, and therefore responded with a more professional and polite F you. This way he understood he was in the wrong and his failure to respect others burned a potential opportunity. I could tell this guy was surprised because of my response and the nearby witnesses had a strange awe imprinted on their faces.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAlways try your best to be respectful to others, and then if you are treated with disrespect, you will know that it is unjustified and be confident in returning the favor if you feel like it.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;','','Don\'t Be A Dick','','publish','post','open','open','','dont-be-a-dick','','','2014-10-04 18:39:07','2014-10-04 18:39:07',0,0,'','http://www.couchdivorce.com/?p=3115',3115) made by call_user_func, WP_Import->dispatch, WP_Import->import, WP_Import->process_posts, wp_insert_post
